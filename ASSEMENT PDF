• ML/LLM: LangChain, Sentence Transformers, FAISS
• Data Processing: BeautifulSoup4, Pandas, Numpy
• Deployment: Docker, Docker Compose
• Vector Database: FAISS (primary), Qdrant (optional)
3. Implementation Details
3.1 Data Pipeline
• Web Scraping: Used BeautifulSoup4 with respectful crawling (delay between requests, proper headers)
• Data Structure: Extracted key fields: title, description, skills, duration, experience level, job roles
• Data Storage: JSON format with metadata for versioning and updates
• Data Enrichment: Skill extraction using keyword matching, duration normalization
3.2 RAG System Design
Embedding Strategy:
• Primary: all-MiniLM-L6-v2 (Sentence Transformers)
• Alternative: OpenAI embeddings (configurable)
1
• Vector Index: FAISS for efficient similarity search
Hybrid Retrieval:
• BM25: Keyword-based matching (lexical search)
• FAISS: Semantic similarity (dense vectors)
• Fusion: Weighted combination of both scores
Final Score = α · Semantic + β · Lexical + γ · Feature Match
where α = 0.4, β = 0.3, γ = 0.3
Query Understanding:
• Feature extraction: Duration, experience level, skills, job roles
• Query expansion using synonyms
• Intent classification for different query types
3.3 Recommendation Logic
Multi-Stage Filtering:
1. Duration filter (must match or be shorter than requested)
2. Skill matching (weighted by relevance)
3. Experience level alignment
4. Job role relevance
Ranking Algorithm:
• Combines semantic similarity, keyword matches, and feature alignment
• Time complexity: O(log n) for retrieval
• Returns top-K recommendations with confidence scores

3.4 Web Application
API Endpoints:
• POST /recommend: Single query recommendation
• POST /batch-recommend: Batch processing
• GET /catalog-stats: System statistics
• POST /predict-test: Generate test predictions
Response Format:
{
"query": "Java developer with communication skills",
"recommendations": [
{
"url": "https://.../core-java",
"title": "Core Java Assessment",
"score": 0.92,
"duration": "40 minutes",
"skills": ["java", "oop"]
}
],
"explanation": "Recommended because...",
"count": 3
}
